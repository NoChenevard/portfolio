Intructions : 
- click on the handle 
- click on the red button when the first animation is finish 
- you can mute the sound if you want

Features : 
- the machine vibrates when you active it
- gearings rotate with a little delay between them 
- the needles follow the rise of electricity 
- images will pop during animation 
- there is some smoke from the back of the screen  

Some informations : 
- most of the time there is a normal animation and a boosted one 
- in style.css I used the same order : Initilization / Creation of the animation / keyframes 
- I used JS for the interactions (buttons) and for the sound 
- I have reduced the sizes of images to avoid lags 


Thanks :
- my class mates for ideas and debug 
- The tuto I used for the smoke : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KrsH0wuanY
